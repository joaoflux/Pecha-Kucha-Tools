A simple PechaKucha Player, that allows playing PechaKucha presentations consisting of 20 slides plus underlying audio file. No database, no server side script, content is stored in a directory structure.

The project aims to allow archiving PechaKucha presentations and integrating them websites in an economic low tech manner (via iFrames or by deeplinking).
