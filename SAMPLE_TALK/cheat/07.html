<h1>Some Notes for Event Organizers</h1>
<ul>
<li>Best practice is to set up the whole event on your web server</li>
<li>Ask speakers to send you their slides and notes as properly formatted files</li>
<li>Upload everything to your event directory (name it whatever you like)</li>
<li>Name the sub directories for the talks 01, 02, 03, etc., depending on how many speakers you have</li>
<li>Add and edit the _config.jason files in all talk directories</li>
</ul>
