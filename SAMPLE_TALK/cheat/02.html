<ul>
<li>You can add notes for each slides in the same manner you add images</li>
<li>The naming convention is 01.html - 20.html</li>
<li>Theoretically you can style your notes however you like using HTML and inline CSS</li>
<li>But there is no need to use HTMl at all, if you just want plain, unformatted text</li>
<li>For this example I used Headline (h1), paragraph (p)</li>
<li> and a simple list (ul and li tags, no custom styling)</li>
</ul>
